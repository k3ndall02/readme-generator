  ## Description
  This README-genernator will allow you to input your information without having to create one from scratch. After reading the requirements for this assignment I figured it would be one of the more simple ones but I still needed a little help so I did some research on Youtube and found a couple videos that I picked from. One of the videos didn't have someone explaining what they were doing so I decided to do what I understood and scheduled a tutor session.
