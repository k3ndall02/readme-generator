# Mag Farms 

  


  ## Description
  The motivation behind this project comes from having the ability to grow my own produce but not just for myself. Others would be able to use this app to order fresh produce straight from the source. Could be either delivered or picked up at the farm. What I learned during this project is how to make a mini slide show play of the product while the cursor hovers it or while not scrolling on a mobile screen.
